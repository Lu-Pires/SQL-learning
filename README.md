# SQL-learning
organizing my personal sql projects for educational purposes only
Done mostly with Thomas Nield's "Getting Started with SQL" ([https://github.com/thomasnield/oreilly_getting_started_with_sql][github] ) and "SQL pocket guide" by Alice Zhao (available at [Oreilly website][https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/] )
